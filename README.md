=============

Hi all. 
So we've created software that can visualize emotion. Once you can see something, you can better manage it.
The colors represent specific, neurobiologically validated categories of emotion. 

We're trying our best to update the software as we go, but until we get a full-time programmer on the team (this month hopefully) things may be slow. 


To track the issues we're working on, see here:

  Thanks, Dr Keener, Matt.
